                        I am Trinity and that's probably all you need to know about me, anyway. (I know you're reading this, Agent Smith)
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        I have a wide range of hacking skills, from taking down simple script-kiddie operations to compromising the financial systems of nation states.
                        Once, I discovered a 0-day in a database client used by numerous security agencies and corporations around the world. I leverage it to created an exploit chain that delivered a malicious
                        payload right into the heart of the most secretive agency in the Matrix. The shellcode that I was able to run on their
                        servers allowed me to stay undetected for nearly a year while exfiltrating documents that ultimately proved that the 
                        whole world I had previously known was an illusion. I won the Pwnie awards that year. You could say it was well-deserved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not reverse engineering malware, writing undetectable rootkits or practicing impossible martial arts moves
                        on sentient computer programs that have an uncanny resemblance to Hugo Weaving, I can be found flying my trusted 
                        old ship <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> around a post-apocalyptic landscape. <span>Hi Neo, pick up the phone.</span>
